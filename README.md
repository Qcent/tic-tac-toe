# tic-tac-toe

A JavaScript tic tac toe game for a web browser

## Description
While browsing classmates repositories for any interesting projects i came across this not quite functional version of tick tac toe.
I took it upon myself to study and comment on the code line by line to understand it's logic. I have brought the code into what i consider a working state but there are still some issues i have with it. Mainly that i want to have a better way of changing thew styles of the boxes involved in the winning moves played. and i would like to add an ai to play against some day also.
