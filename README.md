# tic-tac-toe

A JavaScript tic tac toe game for a web browser

## Description
While browsing classmates repositories for any interesting projects I came across this not quite functional version of tic tac toe. I took it upon myself to study and comment on the code line by line to understand its logic. I have brought the code into what I consider a working state but there are still some issues I have with it. Mainly that I want to have a better way of changing the styles of the boxes involved in the winning moves played. and I would like to add an 'AI' to play against some day also.

## Issues
none currently found in code :)

but I'm not sure i understand the form of object/function declaration for the 'game' and 'board' objects. it uses an arrow function declaration and is wrapped in ellipsis. and possible calls its self after it's declaration.  I must learn more about javascript obviously.
